2017-08-17 VAM RFP review

Echo'd the problem
lack of knowledge

Fileman modelling
	VICS has to be a refined model over base model
	Fileman model vs Services model


=> With no change in CPRS (delphi) or VISTA (MUMPS)

1. No change in VISTA or CPRS code or system 
	=> FAIL
2. Any new code is not MUMPS; all code must be JS/Node
3. Must use proper cloud-compatible DB  (Mongo)
	=> No Fileman / MUMPS
4. How build one of these services


If need to change CPRS => FAIL

Do they understand the problem?
	Requires routing RPCs to
	If REST over Fileman - there is no understanding

VISTA keeps its existing interfaces
	we are not enhancing vista
	we are taking AWAY from vista
		in a way that it still functions

CPRS not change; VISTA not change
	if have to add new file types to VISTA, have to do it x130
	if adding to vista, not solving the problem


Four major concepts:
- taking away, not adding/enhancing vista
- No MUMPS alterned, or in final solution
- national services in node/js cloud database
- cprs/vista code do not change


If changing vista/ fileman / cprs => FAIL
this is not a filemn maintenance project


Deployment plan:
	turn OFF


No master model
Data modelling poor
Putting REST on Fileman entity file
Changing CPRS:  NOT ALLOWED.  Was specifically addressed in RTEP
Can only write JS
No CPRS change
Vista loses function, not gain



=> VISTA retirement project
	If enhancing VISTA - wrong
	This is about retiring VISTA




Do they understand the problem?
[1] client CPRS/server VISTA unchanged 
[2] VISTA services (4 in particular) are being retired 
	- no VISTA enhancement; rather there is vista retirement
[3] the national replacement for 4 functions (in 130 VISTAS) 
	is written in node.js/NPM install on a mainstream Cloud database

... do you understand [3] === do you have a realistic architecture for a national service

... did they answer the RTEP questions in particular or just give process language echo the PWS?









==================== B3 Group

=> have to lose on lack of specificity
=> do not show understanding; they simply cut and pasted my own diagrams


Deeply resent being given back my own diagrams
"close to plagiarism"
Research I have done myself is being 
	Shows no understanding of research I did myself
Would that cause any trouble?

This shows no understanding of significance of diagrams
	literally copied diagram with no modification
No new information
copies text and digrams verbatim from website  (my diagrams!)
	no understanding
Dont want to 
Open source project -
	but sureely they need to show understanding and knowledge




Gov product
Incumbent who developed is also 
Incumbent bidding on the project

Ablevets has done the VDP
has been endorsed by a competing offering

Why would we

Took VA diagram and gave back to us


No incumbent
two respondents leveraging VDP
	one is doing VDP
	one is endorsing another teams know-how and VDP

=> they are giving me back my own figures from my own slideware
=> don't echo back answers to questions
=> dont give VA slideware back to VA



=> B3 has endorsed one Ablevets project
	and have literally copy/pasted the novel digrams and documentation from Ablevets in their proposal
	will use the work Ablevets has done to do this work


Ablevets: have moved on from one of their existing projects - the one listed by B3.  Ablevets is an enhancment of VDP.

Ablevets is not incumbent - has moved on; is experienced



repeading work of open soruce va/dod project that they did not do
which was one of the projecgts performed by another submitter (Ablevets)
re-using diagrams and terminology from that project
does not show capability by copying and repeating something they took off a website?

This shows no understanding of the problem
simply copying things performed in the VDP project
by aonother applicatnt

This is the nature of open source 
just copying preveiouslfy funded governemtn work 
shows no understanindg of problem
nor gives any creditiliby / confidence that they can peform the work


Close to plagiarism - because did not even bother to change the diagrams or wording.

Legally they can take open source 

Nothing wroing with using open source code
but dont take and show it as is, and proclaim you now understand it
No value-add in their copying gov funded work by another party

how can we know they understand it 
they simply copied from an 

The fact they didn't modify it shows they don't understand it

Verbatim, exact copies of diagrams and words from the VDP website
shows no insight or capability


Giving us back what we already have on the VA's website.

Copy-pasting pre-exising gov funded joint va-dod research did not invole them, 	actually perofrmed by another applicant.   


=> There is no incumbent, however must show understanding of pronciples, and cant just repeat work done by others.


=> No mention of VISTA retirement: IOC must include
national deployment following IOC such that CPRS is able to retain full functionality against a single centralized service, replacing those functions of the original, 131 de-centralized VistA source instances.  The Offerorâ€™s approach shall indicate its approach to retirement of that service in the 131, de-centralized VistA instances, while maintaining full continuity of service in the CPRS client [PWS 5.7].


=> no mention of vista retirement
=> generic words of virtualization and defect reports;
	not interested in VIP process
=> want specfics of CPRS with vista is retired
=> no RPC router

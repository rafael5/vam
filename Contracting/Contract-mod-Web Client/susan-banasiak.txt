Bob,
 
As discussed on the call, add in the requirements for the Mobile Client development starting on  page 15.  Donâ€™t forget to add in any deliverables. 
 
We will also need the attached final IGCE revised for just the new requirements.  You can just add in another sheet after the IGCE tab and have the totals there for the new requirements.  If you have any questions just let me know.
 
Thank you J
